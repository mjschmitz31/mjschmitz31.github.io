<center><h3><font color=green>Which of these make triangles congruent?</center></h3></font color=green><br>
Above are the six different ways that sets of 3 corresponding parts can be congruent.<br>  
Your job will be to see which of these actually makes congruent triangles.<br>
<ol>
<li>Click on the links below to get an activity to see what makes triangles congruent.<br>
You must check each of the six scenarios to see which ones give you congruent triangles.<br>

<a href=http://illuminations.nctm.org/activity.aspx?id=3504>Here is the activity</a><br>
<li>Write down which of the six are ways to prove triangles congruent and which are not.
<li>Use the triangle congruence theorems that you just found and, with your group, choose one of the proofs on

and fill it out completely.<br>
<li>Now that you have used your triangle theorems in proofs, let's see if you can answer these questions.
	Click on <a href=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3xooy6iMZRlczU2NkJTSF9kYjQ/view?usp=sharing>this link,</a>
	print out the page, and with your group answer the questions.<br>
<li>Now it is time to consider how specific triangles can be congruent.  Let's look at right triangles.<br>
Click <a href=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3xooy6iMZRlVWlidDFud2JlYjA/view?usp=sharing>here</a> and with your group do the activity and answer the questions.<br>
<li>What are the 3 theorems that you came up with?
<li>Finally, it is time to prove one of your theorems.  With your group:

<li>make a copy of the google doc 
<li>name it your group's number
<li>finish the proof
<li>share the google doc with me
